Exercise: Cruise Ships
Over the next couple of weeks, we are going to cover further aspects of Object-oriented Programming - namely how we pass objects into one another and test for this, how we decide what methods and properties our objects should have, how we isolate objects in tests, and how we test behaviour that's outside of our control.

Learning objectives

To be able to answer "yes" to the following questions:

Can you explain what Object-oriented Programming is?
Can you effectively break down a user story into a domain model?
Can you use dependency injection to get objects to talk to each other?
Can you use mocks to emulate dependencies in tests?
Can you use spies to track call history of other functions?
